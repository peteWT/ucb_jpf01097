* Forest Products and Bioenergy Extension: A Strategic Vision
foobas  
** Forest Products
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[./images/forestproducts.png]]
* Notes
Treats:
Lack of external awareness of UC ANR
• Other agencies filling void without sciencebased
knowledge
• Cost of living and labor in California
• “Cottage Extension Programs” on other UC
campuses – lack of coordination and
collaboration
• Speed of information flow – quantity and
quality
• General population lacks scientific knowledge
• California water concerns
"The general disciplinary focus of this position is the sustainable use of forest and wood resources."

"The general disciplinary focus of this position is the sustainable use of forest and wood resources. Priority issues include life-cycle assessments and carbon cycles of forest products including wood-based bioenergy, efficiency and conservation in forest products and bioenergy technology, and the impacts of utilization on community development, economic, and environmental concerns. The CE Specialist in Forest Products and Biomass will develop and promote methods for efficient and environmentally acceptable utilization of wood resources and woody biomass and analyze the impacts of forest management practices and utilization on the ability of the state to meet its greenhouse gas emission goals. "

** John notes:

+ Take credit, explain role
+ Dont run long shoot for 40 minutes
+ Talk about forest products
  + List forest products
+ Life cycle analysis
  + Importance of forest products in climate policy
+ Results slide for Redwood

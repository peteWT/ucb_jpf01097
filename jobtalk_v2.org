 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 *Findings*
 + No significant differences between NZ and CA
 + Regional differences

 *Next Steps*
 + Combine high spatial resolution soil, climate, and stand density data with wood properties data to mine predictors of wood properties
 + Work with NZ researchers to evaluate potential to rapidly evaluate redwood properties using reflectance properties or automated detection of micro-structural properties from imagery  
 + reach out to industrial to develop a research agenda to inform siviculture that encourages properties that add value (appearance, durability)

#+ATTR_REVEAL:</small>
#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. What forest product utilization strategies minimize climate pollution and public health impacts?
   - Capture and store carbon from mortality events? (Bio-char)
   - Displacement and substitution of products? (Energy, fuels, products)
   - More trees -- less products? (Carbon offsets, investment in fire suppression)
   - What strategies align with the range of public values in forests?

2. Can innovation in the forest product sector improve our ability to efficiently and sustainably?
   - Does the benefit of investing in maintenance of un-utilized capacity in the forest products sector return meaningful climate benefits?
   - opportunties to expand the applications for sustainably harvested wood products?
     - prefabricated buildings
     - modular construction

3. What are effective strategies for public education around sustainable forest products?

** Funding and collaboration

* Extension Priorities
1. Develop a robust applied research platform with strong collaboration between UC, CA and non-CA groups in collaboration with county Advisers
2. Engage actively in public discourse relevant to forest products, climate change, and forest sustainability
   - Social media
   - Workshops/fora
   - Policy initiatives
   - Provide comment on agency initiatives
3. Provide technical assistance to forest products and bioenergy sector
   - Close collaboration with county advisors
   - Align research with barrier issues identified through outreach
   - Provide review and guidance on proposal

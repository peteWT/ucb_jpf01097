#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Redwood quality issues with rotation age
+ Expansion of production in New Zealand
#+END_NOTES

*** Redwood Results
+ No significant differences between NZ and CA
+ Regional differences suggest local variables drive wood property differences
#+BEGIN_NOTES
*Findings*
+ No significant differences between NZ and CA
+ Regional differences

*Next Steps*
+ Combine high spatial resolution soil, climate, and stand density data with wood properties data to mine predictors of wood properties
+ Work with NZ researchers to evaluate potential to rapidly evaluate redwood properties using reflectance properties or automated detection of micro-structural properties from imagery

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
 *TODO* Add cols for gross output
 + Emphasize that CA industry focuses primarily on commodity lumber markets, little value added processing
  #+END_NOTES
* Renewable Energy
+ Fuels
+ Biomass power
+ Heating and cooling

* Carbon Cycle of Wood Products 
+ Integrated industrial/forest ecology
+ Lack of data
+ Need for science based leadership

* Public Education
+ Raising public awareness/interest in forests as places of *both* recreation/wilderness *and* livelihood, material production

** Smurfs ?!

* Research questions
1. What forest product utilization strategies minimize climate pollution and public health impacts?
2. What strategies align with the range of public values for forests?
3. What innovations in the forest product sector improve our ability to efficiently and sustainably manage forests?
4. What are effective strategies for public education around sustainable forest products?


#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. What forest product utilization strategies minimize climate pollution and public health impacts?
   - Capture and store carbon from mortality events? (Bio-char)
   - Displacement and substitution of products? (Energy, fuels, products)
   - More trees -- less products? (Carbon offsets, investment in fire suppression)
   - What strategies align with the range of public values in forests?

2. Can innovation in the forest product sector improve our ability to efficiently and sustainably?
   - Does the benefit of investing in maintenance of un-utilized capacity in the forest products sector return meaningful climate benefits?
   - opportunties to expand the applications for sustainably harvested wood products?
     - prefabricated buildings
     - modular construction

3. What are effective strategies for public education around sustainable forest products?
   -

* Extension Priorities

1. Develop a robust applied research platform with strong collaboration between UC, CA and non-CA groups in collaboration with county Advisers
2. Engage actively in public discourse relevant to forest products, climate change, and forest sustainability
   - Social media
   - Workshops/fora
   - Policy initiatives
   - Provide comment on agency initiatives
3. Provide technical assistance to forest products and bioenergy sector
   - Close collaboration with county advisors
   - Align research with barrier issues identified through outreach
   - Provide review and guidance on proposal

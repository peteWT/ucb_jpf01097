  #+BEGIN_NOTES
 *Role*
  + Assisted in writing proposal with All-Power Labs and UCB-RAEL
  + Advised graduate students (reader for Jose Lara's masters thesis -- ERG)
  + Assisted with methodology development and analysis
 *Motivating questions*
 + Can distributed generation address the challenges of wood biomass bulk density

*** Analysis Framework
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
 [[./images/flow_chart.png]]

*** Key Findings

 + Range of SLCP emissions estimates
 + Roundwood harvest results in a *net emissions reduction* compared to no harvest assuming sustained yield forestry and no land conversion.
 + Critical need for improved data and monitoring:
   + Emissions :: Black and brown carbon emissions from pile, prescribed and wildfire
   + Displacement :: Need better understanding of wood and energy use in residential/commercial construction specific to California.

*** Different estimates
 Divergence between BOE and CARB based estimates
+ Air Resources Board :: Criteria Pollutant Emissions Inventory
  + *2.5 MMT CO2e*
+ Board of Equalization :: Historical harvest data from timber tax records
  + *0.57 MMTCO2e*
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ CARB estimate includes emissions from pile burning not associated with commercial timber harvest
#+END_NOTES
*** Emissions reduction
 - Wood harvested in California in 2012 resulted in avoided emissions of
   *2.29 MMTCO2e*

 - Timber harvest producing roundwood including emissions from pile burning of logging residuals results in a net emissions reduction of *1.93 MMTCO2e*

   - What strategies align with the range of public values in forests?

2. Can innovation in the forest product sector improve our ability to efficiently and sustainably?
   - Does the benefit of investing in maintenance of un-utilized capacity in the forest products sector return meaningful climate benefits?
   - opportunties to expand the applications for sustainably harvested wood products?
     - prefabricated buildings
